<div id=about>
<p>I enjoy playing Sudoku online, but it can get a little annoying because each
site has a slightly different way to interact. On most sites you can click and
then type a number to solve a cell. But there are almost as many ways to mark
candidates as there are sites with puzzles. And some sites don't even support
marks! I created this extension to smooth over these differences so I don't have
to worry as much about which site I'm on and I can instead just work on the
puzzles.</p>
<p>I know if I print out the page I can make all those site differences
completely disappear, and all I need to know is how to use a pencil. I'm sure
you've guessed by now that this is the inspiration behind this extension. The
pencil-and-paper interaction is fairly easy to implement, but more importantly
it is easy to understand and use. And it should work with pretty much any
site.</p>
<p>There are other extensions that let you doodle. Some even let you share your
doodles with the world. And there are fully featured drawing programs that run
in the browser. Those are fantastic extensions/apps, but they don't feel quite
right for this task. They make the doodles the important thing when instead it
should be the puzzle solving.</p>
<p>I should also point out that there are apps available (not necessarily
browser based) specifically for solving puzzles. They are also fantastic, but I
find much more satisfaction from doing the work myself. So, in keeping with
the inspiration, this extension helps to solve puzzles only as much as
pencil-and-paper does.</p>
</div>

<div id=ports>
<p>The simple way to think of the doodle button is as a toggle, but, of course,
the reality is a bit more complicated. Some javascript code must be injected
into a page to allow doodling, but it would be a waste to do that to all the
pages that never get doodled upon. So the first time you press the doodle button
isn't really a toggle at all. This extension's background page keeps track of
which pages have been injected, so when you click on the button it knows whether
to tell the page to toggle or to inject the doodling code into the page.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? Well, at the moment the only way to set any options is
to add your own javascript code to the injected code. What you enter on the
<b>Options</b> tab is appended to the contents of the
<a href="hack.html">inject.js</a> file, and the result is what gets
injected. Yes, it is a stretch to call this "setting options", but that's how it
works for now. You'll need to understand what is being injected and exactly when
that code gets injected in order to do anything useful with the <b>Options</b>
tab.</p>
</div>

<div id=known>
<p>Here are some behaviors that might seem like bugs at first, but are really
due to things that this extension can't do much about:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Resizing</dt><dd>
<p>Changing the size of the browser window can cause things on the page to move
around in very complex ways. Figuring out which thing a doodle should move with
would be incredibly complicated. It's a fun idea, but it doesn't seem practical
at all. So doodles just never move at all: each has a fixed position from the
upper-left corner of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Zooming</dt><dd>
<p>Almost everything works fine when zoomed in or out... except the type of
erasing where you sweep out an area around doodles. This seems to be a bug in
the browser, and so I've filed a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=155277">bug
report</a>.</p>
<p>Until that bug gets fixed you'll have to cancel zooming
(<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>) before using this type of erasing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Framesets</dt><dd>
<p>Doodles cannot cross the borders between frames.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Flash</dt><dd>
<p>The Flash player is capable of drawing inside the browser window, but the
default configuration is to draw on top of the browser window. The authors of
each web page make that decision, but they rarely need to display anything over
the top of Flash content, so they use the default. Unfortunately this means
doodles will most likely be hidden underneath the Flash content.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Chrome Web Store has pages where you can <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/support/adcigljcdlemflbekljdfohfpipeolof">report bugs + make suggestions</a> and/or <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doodledoku/adcigljcdlemflbekljdfohfpipeolof/reviews">rate + write a review</a>.</p>
