It is funny people even take these people seriously, when they are PAID to be in an advertising. Shoot, if I was paid 200,000 to lie in a commercial, I probably would too! You have to think about people's motivations and almost all motivations revolve around money.<p>

Uhm, it was not taken out of context. It was what it was and it was the most the insulting statement I have heard out of that guys mouth yet. You can try to spin it anyway you want but we are not as stupid as you and we see the forest through the trees. I was gonna not vote at all because I don't want either of them in the office and I hate Romney as much as I hate Obama but guess what? I'm voting now because that was the last straw and the nail in the coffin. Obama must go with a view like that<p>

There must be NO gov't involvement in ANY business, and gov't has no business giving out any types of loans or any types of insurance or any other dealings, but gov't has no business being this large and being everywhere, regulating any business, taxing income, printing money.

This would be the perfect opportunity for Obama, and government in general, to remind us of how big a role they have played in developing the business community. Think of all of the industry created during and after after WWII, aerospace, spin-offs from NASA, university research, much of it federally funded, that has led to inventions ranging from tomato harvesters to most of our drugs. The govennment role in the semiconductor industry, inventing the Internet, and much more.<p>

You wingnuts have gotten so contorted, distorting the truth, that you're starting to talk out of your ass. Government - which you've demonized forever & blamed Obama for referencing as doing more than a little good by businesses, whether in getting started, or in coming to the rescue when times are hard, or in revamping roads & transport that will impact traffic to their benefit - is now a justifiable necessity?! as though it was Obama who'd railed against this symbiotic relationship?!<p>

Yes, but where would that top 10% have gotten to if they hadn't been supported with the Infrastructure?<p>
No one is saying the Government didn't need help to grow, Romney and Obama both confirm that it's business supporting government that has built up Washington and that it's Washington supporting business that builds up the economy.<p>
It's a symbiotic relationship where both need each other to prosper,<p>

The top 10% earn over 40% of all income, while the bottom 50% earn less than 15% of the income. So, yes, the top 10% should pay higher taxes.<p>

38% of my EARNED income...the income I wake up every morning at 5:00 and work until 5 or 6 at night...goes to taxes...38%. The people who you are defending...the upper 1% of this country...the ones who you say EARNED their money...the ones who play golf and write it off as a business expense...pay about 15% of their income to taxes. So although they certainly pay more MONEY towards taxes...that's only because they make millions...they dont pay as much of their income to taxes as you or I do.<p>

I'm sure you think you're very clever, but we know where the government gets it's money and how it functions. Nobody minds business owners getting rich (hell, I'm a small business owner), it's when they start complaining about paying extra in tax (what they do for the government) and acting like the government has never done anything for them (which is a lie) that we get pissed.<p>

Most of the technological advances we have see over the last 70yrs is as a result of direct government investment in many cases it was as a result of government investment plus government employees.<p>
Research which often seems to esoteric for the private sector to gamble on is often funded by the taxpayer before being passed to the private sector for growth & exploitation.<p>

Yeah, he really didn't...and if he were he would tell you like he has said many times. It's been through great employees who had a lot of control of what the company did. Jobs even had them sign their names on the original MAC's so everyone could see it's not the company, but the people who made it. This kind of idiocy is the epitome of Republican ideology.<p>

I don't see the connection. Apple could never have been created without the massive public investment and state involvement of the Postwar-era, that is the fact of the matter. One can argue that the private sector would have developed these aswell, but there is no scientific evidence to prove that could have happened, for the reason that these are long-term investments spanning decades of research and development, with no guarantee of economic profit. In 1963, the public share in R&D was at 67%.<p>

I don't see the connection here. Eisenhower initiated a massive jobs program and public investment effort in creating the Interstate Highway System, using defense as a pretext, as usual. Eisenhower expanded the National Science Foundation and National Health Foundation enormously, both agencies were involved in nearly all research and development aspects of this nation. In 1963, the public share in total research and development spending was at 67%, as was more or less the case during Eisenhower<p>

Really? Obama is personally stealing money from America's children? Are you fucking serious? It's not like the money that he is getting through what little taxes are collected anymore (not from anyone's children btw) are going towards infrastructure and education and defense (unfortunately). Nooo. Obama is personally stealing that money. He needs it for his car elevator. DUH<p>

The Treasury collects 3.6 Trillion per year and President Obama spends that plus 1.5 Trillion more. That 4 Billion per day that future generation have to pay back.<p>
MrSpencerport in reply to Alwaystay InTheLoop (Show the comment) 10 hours ago<p>
But that money doesn't just dissolve into nothing. It is being spent on something right? It is being spent on growing the economy which will in turn make more money. Austerity DOES NOT work! The euro and Spain especially are on the verge of collapse because they're government isn't spending enough. In a recession, if consumers refuse to spend money because they are frightened by instability, how will the economy ever recover if not through stimulus? It's simple economic common sense.<p>

Moving towards balancing the budget is not austerity but borrowing 4 Billion per day is economic suicide.<p>

(cont) for businesses we depend on the loans that get us started we depend on the customers who buy our goods, on the many businesses that make our product possible (manufacturing, shipping, legal, etc) we depend on our employees, and all of them depend on you and the things mentioned above. we all support each other often without even trying as a simple emergent property of the system.<p>
so if you have a business you didnt build it on your own, you got help. and you should be grateful.<p>

humility doesn't initiate the spark of innovation in a lot of people. many people are an island in the early phases of development, especially in the newer sciences where a single man or small group of people can make an honest living. the economy has changed, this is the reason our economy IS in shambles, because we don't need to rely on lots of infrastructure to make things for the global economy (who pays for the roads for my Taiwanese customers?).

These fake conservatives don't understand free market economics. They don't even know how to argue right. The one that does say it like it is no one wants to listen to. Wealth comes from the private sector. It is savings that leads to capital that leads to production that leads to wealth. All the taxes come from the private sector. Government employees do not pay taxes. They simply get paid a little more or less. Just because the government has a monopoly does not mean it can't be done privately<p>
bigboywasim 12 hours ago<p>
It is the government that drains the private sector. It is government that taxes, regulates, runs huge deficits and makes it so the currency has to be devalued. Businesses simply adjust their behavior and do what is in their best interest. If politicians are for sale then they get bought. If your competitor is getting an unfair advantage from the government then you need to get it to (even if you think it is wrong) or you will lose. Unforeseen and unintended consequences of the central planners.<p>
